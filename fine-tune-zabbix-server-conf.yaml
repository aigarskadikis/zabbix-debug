- Go to Monitoring -> Grapghs:
  - Select Group: Zabbix servers
  - Select Host: Zabbix server
    - Select: Zabbix data gathering process busy %
      - if there is dots in the screen there is a possibility that timeout has been configured in the zabbix_agentd.conf
    
    - Select: Zabbix cache usage, % free
      - if the history write cache is droping, this means zabbix syncer can not write metrics in database in timeout
        - Open graph: Zabbix internal process busy % and see if the histoy syncer process is busy
          - if it is like the recheck on database engine. What is the version for MySQL
            - does inno_per_table is enabled
            # vi /etc/my.cnf.d/server.cnf
[mysqld]
innodb_file_per_table = 1
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 4G			# ~75% of total available memory 
innodb_buffer_pool_instances = 4
innodb_flush_method = O_DIRECT
innodb_log_file_size = 256M
optimizer_switch=index_condition_pushdown=off # for faster startup for the backend server to not pick up everything
query_cache_type = 0
max_connections = 1000
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2
